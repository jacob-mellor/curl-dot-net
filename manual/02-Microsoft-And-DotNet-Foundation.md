# Microsoft, .NET Foundation, and Enterprise Readiness

CurlDotNet is designed to feel at home in the Microsoft ecosystem.  
This guide explains how the project aligns with Microsoft’s engineering practices, .NET Foundation guidance, and enterprise expectations.

## Microsoft Alignment

- **Language First** – Pure C# implementation that runs anywhere .NET runs (Windows, Linux, macOS, containers, mobile).
- **Copy/Paste Experience** – Solves a classic Microsoft developer pain point: turning curl commands from docs, Azure, or GitHub into working .NET code.
- **PowerShell & DevOps** – Enables Windows and Azure engineers to reuse battle-tested curl commands inside PowerShell or C# build scripts without shelling out to native binaries.

## .NET Foundation Principles

- **Open Governance** – Issues, discussions, and documentation are public. The roadmap lives in `CONTINUING_WORK.md`.
- **Transparent Engineering** – High code coverage, DocFX docs, and detailed XML comments provide the “why” and the “how”.
- **Ecosystem Friendly** – Targets .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.7.2, .NET 8, and future .NET releases so libraries, MAUI apps, Xamarin apps, and Unity builds can consume CurlDotNet.

## Enterprise Readiness

- **Security** – No native dependencies, no shelling out, and full control over HTTP stack behavior.
- **Supportability** – Extensive XML documentation, markdown manuals, and GitHub issues make adoption auditable.
- **Attribution & Sponsorship** – Clearly references curl’s original authors and sponsorship from IronSoftware for trust and compliance.

## Call to Action

If you’re building enterprise applications on Microsoft technologies, CurlDotNet gives you the same power you enjoyed on Linux shells—now natively in .NET with full observability and documentation. Compliment it with other UserlandDotNet components (coming soon) to recreate an entire Unix toolkit inside Visual Studio and PowerShell.
